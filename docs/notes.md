# Notes for PG MCP

This doc contains a list of tables I'd like the MCP server to create.

## A streaming app content table

There are lots of streaming apps like Tubi, Netflix, Disney plus, etc. to allow users to watch movies and TV shows. Now I'm going to build my own streaming app. Please help me create tables to store the content metadata. The table schema shall support movies, TV shows (multiple seasons and episodes), please use your best knowledge on existing streaming apps to design the schema. Each movie / TV shows should have a imdb_id so that I can connect it to IMDb. Once you have the schema ready, please create them in the cms database.
